Re building space invaders (hopefully with fewer bugs)

This is a rebuild of my first JS project, hopefully fixing some of the bugs from my first attempt.
This will be partly pair coded with Cliff as a revision exercise for us both.

My intention once basic set up is complete is to add in some unit tests

## steps
- basic file set up
- initialise grid
- add in player. Check moves.
- add in alien.
  - check aliens move individually!!
- add in player firing functions
- add in alien firing functions
- add in check hit functions
